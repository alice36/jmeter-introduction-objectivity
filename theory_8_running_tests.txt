JMETER GUI is only used to develop scripts not to run them to draw conclusions.
Whn we run jmeter in non-ui mode we need to externalize jmeter script parameters so that we can provide them from the commandline.

    Examples:

    That is the simplest possible run (change your paths please):

    "C:\Users\gstarczewski\tools\apache-jmeter-5.2.1\bin\jmeter.bat" ^
     -n -t "jmeter-introduction.jmx"

     That run provides parameters (we still need to do some work in script for that to work)

     "C:\Users\gstarczewski\tools\apache-jmeter-5.2.1\bin\jmeter.bat" ^
      -n -Jthreads=5 -t "jmeter-introduction.jmx"

    That run includes report generation (default format is CSV):

    "C:\Users\gstarcze\dev tools\apache-jmeter-5.0\apache-jmeter-5.0\bin\jmeter.bat" ^
     -n -Jthreads=2  -t "jmeter-introduction.jmx" -l jmeter-introduction.csv -e -o jmeter-introduction-html

Parameters

    There are parameters that are defined in jmeter.properties, if a user wants to overwrite them then best practice
    is to create user.properties file in the place where we run tests and override them in that file.

    e.g.

    user.properties
        jmeter.save.saveservice.output_format=xml

    Then you can override thaose user defaults with commandline e.g. -Jjmeter.save.saveservice.output_format=csv
    Summing up order is:

    jmeter.properties->user.properties->command line

Hint:
    Execute jmeter -n in /bin folder to see available options
    You can also place in that file your scripts variables e.g.
        jmeter.save.saveservice.output_format=csv
        threads=10
        whatever=WHATEVER


Remote execution is beyond scope of this training.
You can watch my video on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ2Zm-SDGjI to see how you can run jmeter with
    - maven
    - docker
    - taurus
On Jenkins to enable CI/CD.
See here if you want to run it from code .e.g java: https://www.blazemeter.com/blog/5-ways-launch-jmeter-test-without-using-jmeter-gui/
