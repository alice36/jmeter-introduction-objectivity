Your first place to go is jmeter.log or jmeter-server.log if you exectuee distributed tests.
Alternatively you can:

- Mark Element in the Tree. Enable Debog on individual element in Help -> Enable Debug. Some elements are verbose, some are not at all.
    You can execute this on XPATH assertion element to verify.
- In Your Thread Group add Debug Sampler and View Results Underneath.
