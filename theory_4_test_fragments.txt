This trio allows to re-use common behaviours (elements) with Config & Use parts

Config part:
    Test Fragment - repository of elements/behaviours
    Simple Controller - a bin for element, visible to

Use part:
    Module Controller - is used in your script flow to reference a behaviour from Test Fragment, it can only reference Controllers
                    (most often Simple Controllers) not Samplers hence we need to embed our samplers in Controllers first
