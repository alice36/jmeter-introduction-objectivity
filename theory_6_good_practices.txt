How do modern browsers work ? https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/

 - Usually browsers use around 2-6 threads to fetch resources in parallel.
 - Usually the cache static resources subject to HTTP Cache Control Headers e.g. Expires

Best Practices: Where to find them:

    https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/best-practices.html (let us briefly discuss)

Understanding some of them requires some experience with JMETER so we can discuss them in the course.

On top of that Gabriel's additions (do not have to be true):

    - Treat jmeter tests as code, manage them as code
    - Perform Code Reviews and peer DEMOs
    - Do not try to be performance tester, try to be good engineer then you become good performance tester
    - Understand back-end
    - Always think big: remote executions, CI/CD/CT integration
