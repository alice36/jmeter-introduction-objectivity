Often Used Plan Structure looks like this:

    Test Plan:
        setUpThreadGroup (preparation, data loading, initializations, warm up for db, register users, get oauth tokens, generate random test data..)
        Main ThreadGroups (actual work)
        tearDown (summaries, closing resources, removing temp files, ...)


Test Driven in Jmeter:

    One can use CSV Data Config to pre-load data from CSV files into JMeter variables.
    Those variables will be picked by Thread Group in round robin fashion so if you have 3 variables and 10 threads
    then Thread 1 gets 1 CSV row, THread 2 gets 2 CSV row, Thread 4 gets 1 CSV row etc ...
